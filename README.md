Hello everyone! My name is Juan, but I am known in the virtual world as ElAdagiodeJP. I am currently studying computer engineering and aspire to become a developer in the future. My passion for learning and studying is insatiable, and I always seek to expand my knowledge and wisdom. The pursuit of eudaimonia, that is, human fulfillment and flourishing, also occupies a central place in my life. I firmly believe that personal and spiritual growth are essential to achieve happiness and well-being.

Throughout my academic and personal journey, I have learned to face challenges with determination and find creative solutions. I consider myself a curious, passionate and persevering person. I am always willing to acquire new skills and knowledge to broaden my perspective and contribute meaningfully to the world of technology. I am excited about the opportunities the future holds and look forward to applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that drive technological progress and improve people's lives.
